# miniDEL
**Minidel pseudo-language compiler** (lexer/parser/semantic analyzer) built with Lex, Bison, and C on Linux (compiled via GCC/Flex/Bison), paired with a Django-based web editor featuring syntax highlighting and error diagnostics through a custom JavaScript library. 
The compiler performs lexical, syntactic, and semantic analysis, generating a **symbol table** (tracking variables, types, and scopes) and **quadruples** (intermediate code representations), which are displayed in real-time within the UI alongside a console showing compilation logs and errors. 
The repository excludes the compilerâ€™s source code, providing only precompiled Linux binaries, while the web interface dynamically visualizes the symbol table, quadruple sequences, and compiler output through integrated panels.
